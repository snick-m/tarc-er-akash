# üåÉ TARC Er Akash

**This is a Social Platform for people to communicate anonymously over various localized events and topics of interest.**

The main concept comes from an app that created a feed that is dependent on the users location. This feed contained various interesting events such as fun incidents around a university campus.
This concept intrigued me a lot and I wanted to create a similar app that would prioritize user data security over all else. **Therefore, a DApp**.

###### *TARC is a residential campus of BRAC University where each student must spend exactly one semester. In this time they learn various valuable lessons as well as various fundamental life skills and habits. However, due to being far from family and in a new environment - not having many friends or not being able to make friends is a very painful situation here. Thus the naming and coneptualization of this platform.*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work In Progress
